Thanks for participating with crowdvoice.

We received an email from you, with an attachment for a voice.
The only problem is that: The email that you sent is too big!

Please try again with a smaller size.

The subject of the message that you sent was:

  - <%= @sent_subject %>

The voice-email that you are trying to reach is:

  - <%= @target_receiver %>


Thanks for understanding, we hope to have your contribution.
